These guides provide discussions about specific problems and use cases, as well as in-depth explorations of the important concepts behind the mechanics of a Cloudant database.

Examples include the general [guide for backups](backup-guide.html)
and the [guide for backups using replication](backup-guide-using-replication.html).

For a quick index to the Cloudant API, see the [API reference](../api/index.html).
