# Data Privacy and Governance

_(This Cloudant Data Privacy and Governance Update was originally published April 20, 2016.)_

As a pioneer in the provision of a fully managed and globally distributable Database-as-a-Service,
{{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} allows customers to locate data in any
global SoftLayer or Rackspace datacentre or AWS region.
By providing customers with such high levels of data mobility to serve the local needs of customers,
we must of course take data privacy and governance very seriously.

To govern the movement of data from the EU to the US,
{{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} complied with both US-EU and US-Swiss
[Safe Harbour Frameworks](https://safeharbor.export.gov/companyinfo.aspx?id=29450){:new_window}.
Following last year's ruling of the European Court of Justice that
[invalidated](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=169195&pageIndex=0&doclang=en&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=113326){:new_window}
the Safe Harbour agreement,
IBM was quick to urge policymakers to work expediently
to ensure "[unbroken data flows between the European Union and the United States](http://www.ibm.com/ibm/ibmgra/safe_harbor_10062015.html){:new_window}".

IBM has prepared an EU Model Clauses agreement for {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} customers
to facilitate the transfer of personal data outside of the EU
in accordance with the EU data privacy laws.
EU Model clauses are relevant to all customers
sending personal information relating to EU citizens to {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}}.

To request an EU Model Clauses agreement,
or for any other information or assistance around the transfer of personal data,
customers can contact our dedicated EU Model Clauses team at [eu-mc@ie.ibm.com](mailto:eu-mc@ie.ibm.com).

The EU Directive 95/46/EC sets out rules concerning processing of customer's personal data.
As the data controller,
customers appoint IBM as a data processor to process any personal data which may be included in the customer's content.
In turn,
customers are responsible for obtaining all necessary consents
to include the content (including any personal data) in the IBM {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} solutions.

A list of countries where content may be held,
or from where content may be accessed,
for the purpose of delivering and supporting a Cloud Service,
is available at:
[www.ibm.com/cloud/datacenters](http://www.ibm.com/cloud/datacenters){:new_window}.

More information about Cloudant's overall standards compliance can be found
[here](cloudantcompliance.html).

-   [Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.co.uk/certifications){:new_window}
-   [SoftLayer](http://www.softlayer.com/compliance){:new_window}

Following the recent vote in favour of new
[General Data Protection Regulations](http://www.engadget.com/2016/04/14/eu-data-protection-rules/){:new_window},
it is worth Cloudant customers being aware not only of the Cloudant team's understanding and
compliance against emerging data privacy standards and legislation
but also of IBM's wider ability to provide a comprehensive suite of solutions
to assist businesses of all sizes with their own internal data governance requirements.

If you have further questions about the impending changes to data protection laws in Europe
and how they are likely to impact your business,
or would like to discuss how IBM can support your information governance
and compliance efforts please contact the Client Success team at [cdscsm@us.ibm.com](mailto:cdscsm@us.ibm.com).
