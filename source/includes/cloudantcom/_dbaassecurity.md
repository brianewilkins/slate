## Cloudant DBaaS Data Protection & Security

Protecting application data for large-scale web and mobile apps can be complex,
especially with distributed and NoSQL databases.

Just as it reduces the effort of maintaining your databases,
to keep them running and growing non-stop,
IBM Cloudant also ensures your data stays secure and protected.

## Customer-Proven

Customers have used the Cloudant in production environments since 2009.
Today,
Cloudant is used as the data layer
for hundreds of mission-critical applications in financial services,
government,
e-commerce,
telecommunications,
healthcare,
and other security-minded industries.

## Top-Tier Physical Platforms

The Cloudant DBaaS is
physically hosted on Tier-1 cloud infrastructure providers such as
IBM (SoftLayer) and Amazon.
Therefore,
your data is protected by the network and physical security measures that are employed by these partners,
including (but not limited to):

-   Certifications: Compliance with SSAE16,
    SOC1,
    ISAE 3402,
    ISO 27001,
    CSA,
    and other standards.
-   Access and identity management.
-   '24 x 7' physical security of data centers and network operations center monitoring.
-   Server hardening.
-   Cloudant gives you the flexibility to
    choose or switch among the different providers
    as your SLA and cost requirements change.

## Secure Access Control

A multitude of security features is built into
Cloudant,
for you to control access to data:

-	Authentication: Cloudant is accessed
    by using a RESTful API.
    The user is authenticated for every HTTPS or HTTP request
    Cloudant receives.
-	Authorization: Grant read,
    write,
    admin permissions to specific databases.
-	"In-flight" Encryption: all access to
    Cloudant is encrypted by using HTTPS.
    Enterprise customers can use custom SSL certifications.
-	At-rest Encryption: Data that is stored on disk in
    Cloudant can be encrypted.

-	API Access: Cloudant is accessed programmatically
    by using a RESTful API over secure HTTP (HTTPS).
    API keys can be generated by using
    the Cloudant dashboard.
-	Access Logs: All access to Cloudant
    is logged for auditing purposes.
-	IP Whitelisting: Cloudant Enterprise customers
    can whitelist IP addresses to restrict access to only specified servers and users.

-	CORS: Enable CORS support for specific domains by using the
    Cloudant dashboard.
-	[Shared databases](https://cloudant.com/blog/shared-databases-faq/): Share
    databases with other Cloudant users in
    your organization and configure authorization privileges for each by using
    the Cloudant dashboard.

## Protection Against Data Loss or Corruption

Cloudant has a number of features
to help you maintain data quality and availability:

-	Redundant and durable data storage: By default,
    Cloudant saves to disk three copies
    of every document to three different physical nodes in a cluster.
    Saving the copies ensures that a working failover copy of your data
    is always available,
    regardless of failures.
-	Data Replication and export: You can replicate your databases continuously
    between clusters in different data centers,
    or to an on-premises Cloudant Local cluster,
    or Apache CouchDB.
    Another option is to export data from
    Cloudant (in JSON or CSV format)
    to other locations or sources (such as your own data center)
    for added data redundancy.
-	[Backup](backup-guide.html): Cloudant
    Enterprise users can request that their databases be
    backed up incrementally to a cluster of their choice,
    to protect against data corruption or deletion.
    Backup enables database restoration from a previous time,
    and document-level compare and restore by using the dashboard.
    >   **Note**: This form of backup is not available for an IBM Bluemix Cloudant instance.
