Cloudant is certified under
the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27001 standard,
which defines the expectations for information security management processes.
The ISO 27001 standard specifies the requirements for establishing,
implementing,
and documenting "Information Security Management Systems" (ISMS)
and the requirements for implementing security controls,
according to the needs of individual organizations.
The ISO 27000 family of standards incorporates a process of scaling risk and valuation of assets,
with the goal of safeguarding the confidentiality,
integrity,
and availability of the written,
oral,
and electronic information.

Cloudant is audited by a third-party security firm
and meets all of the requirements for ISO 27001:
